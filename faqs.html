	<h1>FAQS</h1>

	Lifting weights is the primary activity of Minnesota Barbell Club.
	Whether it be with friends or individually the goal is to get
	stronger and share your progress. Weekly meetings are available to
	discuss personal victories, technical aspects of lifting, and the
	community at large. Regular events include club max out days, mock
	meets, and sanctioned meets as well as non lifting social events.
	<br />
	<br />
	The University of Minnesota is one of the most physically active
	campuses in the nation and lifting weights is an essential part of
	any active healthy lifestyle. Gopher Barbell brings a competitive
	aspect to that. With the recent rise in popularity of strength
	sports like weightlifting, crossfit, and powerlifting this club
	fills the need for an organized community for students to
	participate in their hobby and have new people discover a more
	active lifestyle.
	<br />
	<br />
	Members do have the opportunity to acquire membership to the USAPL,
	the largest federation of powerlifting or USAW for Olympic weightlifting.
